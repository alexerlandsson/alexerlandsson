### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer at [Our Studio](https://github.com/ourstudio-se) in Gothenburg, Sweden, driven by the pursuit of pushing CSS to its limits. Over the years, Iâ€™ve been involved in projects for some of Swedenâ€™s most well-known companies, building design systems and applications at scale. I especially enjoy creating scalable design systems, with a strong focus on reusable components and accessibility. 

Here you'll find some of my personal projects.
